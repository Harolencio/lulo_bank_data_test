      ```
   
   - If you don't want to mess up with all these things, you can just download the *zip* file of my GitHub repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/ASHOKKUMAR-K/Machine-Learning-Projects/archive/master.zip) and extract it to any file location as your wish and then use it.
   - Now we have done with the downloading of my whole project.

> **Step 3** :
   - After downloading the whole repo, get into the main folder by hit the following command in git bash for Windows OS users and Terminal for Linux OS users.
   ```bash
   cd lulo_bank_data_test
   ```

> **Step 4** :
   - Now we are going to install all the dependency libraries for this project. Before that you must have Python 3.7.7 and latest version of pip.
   - To install all the dependency libraries in a single command, run the following command.
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
> **Step 5** :
   - After installing all the dependency libraries, you are ready to run my app on your local machine.
